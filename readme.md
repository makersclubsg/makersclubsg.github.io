# hello!

welcome to the maker's club website github repository. (if you're here by mistake somehow, check out [our website](https://makersclubsg.github.io)!)

this is where the code for our website resides. if you dig around, you'll find that our website is made with pure html and css, and _possibly_ minimal javascript.

if you're curious about how this website is made and want to learn more, feel free to poke around the source code, or [drop us a message on discord](https://discord.com/invite/xKNGvVrWX7), [dm us on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/makersclubsg/), or send us an email at makersclubsg@gmail.com. we'd be glad to chat with you!

enjoy your stay here (´._.`)\\(‘́⌣’̀ )
